# codelite-arch
Arch buildscripts for CodeLite

This package provides the PKGBUILD file and required other files to compile codelite for Arch Linux using my fork of CodeLite which is a direct copy but forked and kept up to date with upstream (https://github.com/eranif/codelite/releases) to keep updates stable.

As all PKGBUILD files assume, please have base-devel installed to compile this.
